- [ ] Mention two parts of Express that you learned about this week.

Two parts, or features, of Express that we learned about this week are routing and 
helpers. Routing  provides a way to break an application
 into smaller parts based on the route.helpers are methods added to  
the request and response objects.


- [ ] Describe Middleware?

Middleware is software that provides common services and capabilities to applications. 
Data management, application services, 
messaging, authentication, and API management are all commonly handled by middleware.

- [ ] Describe a Resource?
A resource is an object with a type, associated data, relationships to other resources, 
and a set of methods that operate on it. It is similar to an object instance in an 
object-oriented programming language, with the important difference that only a few standard 
methods are defined for the resource (corresponding to the standard HTTP GET, POST, PUT and 
DELETE methods), while an object instance typically has many methods.

- [ ] What can the API return to help clients know if a request was successful?

The API can return status codes to help clients know if a request was successful or not


- [ ] How can we partition our application into sub-applications?

We can partition our application into sub-applications by using Express Routers to make it
 more modular and easier to maintain.
